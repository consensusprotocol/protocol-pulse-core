## GOVERNING LAWS (this code MUST comply with every law below — flag any violation)
## THE LAWS

### LAW 1: BRAND PALETTE
- Primary Red: #CC2222 (accent, borders, kickers)
- FFmpeg Red: #FF3333 (drawtext/drawbox fallback — closest FFmpeg-safe)
- Background: #0A0A0F (dark navy, never pure black)
- White: #FFFFFF (primary text)
- Gold: #F8C15C (info rail, price displays)
- Mono Font: JetBrains Mono (data, kickers, code)

### LAW 2: PIXEL ZONES
- Full canvas: 1920×1080
- Left panel (PiP): 0–960px wide, full 1080 height
- Right panel (PiP video): 960–1920px
- PiP zone: top-right quadrant x=960-1880, y=0-540
- Subtitle band: y=778-885, full width, dark glass bg
- Info rail: bottom y≈1032-1080, gold text

### LAW 3: TYPOGRAPHY
- Headlines: Bold, white, large (fontsize 42-56)
- Kickers: Red monospace, uppercase, fontsize 24-28
- Body: White, fontsize 28-32
- Sponsor text: White monospace, fontsize 22-26

### LAW 4: COMPONENT PATTERNS
- Cards: Dark bg (#111), red left accent border (3px), white text
- Glass panels: rgba(0,0,0,0.82) fill, subtle border
- Sponsor carousel: 3 rotating cards, 8s per card, FFmpeg enable= timing
- Episode title: Large white bold, "PULSE CHECK" red kicker above

### LAW 5: ANIMATION
- Sponsor rotation: enable='between(t,START,END)' pattern
- Smooth transitions preferred, hard cuts acceptable for data cards
- No debug overlays in production

## TECHNOLOGY STACK
- Python 3.12, Flask 3.x, SQLite via SQLAlchemy ORM
- Ubuntu 24.04 on Ultron server (2x RTX 4090, 93GB RAM)
- All UI animations: CSS/SVG only — NO Three.js, no WebGL, no Canvas
- External services: ElevenLabs TTS, HeyGen avatars, Wav2Lip GPU lip-sync
- ~1000 concurrent users at peak — every route must handle load
- Every DB query on a sort/filter column MUST have an index

## YOUR REVIEW TASK

Perform a forensic code review. Be brutally honest. Cite line numbers.
There is no developer present. No ego to protect. Only quality matters.

### SECTION 1: CORRECTNESS
Walk through the main user flow step by step. Does the code do what it claims?
- Logic errors, wrong variable names, silent failures
- Race conditions (concurrent requests hitting same state)
- N+1 query problems (DB queries inside loops)
- Edge cases that will break in production (empty DB, API timeout, bad input)

### SECTION 2: LAW COMPLIANCE
For each LAW in the governing spec above, state: COMPLIANT / VIOLATION / PARTIAL
Cite specific line numbers for any violation or partial compliance.

### SECTION 3: SECURITY
- SQL injection (check raw queries and ORM filter() with user input)
- Authentication bypasses (routes that should require login but don't)
- Rate limiting gaps (can one user exhaust paid API limits?)
- Secrets in code (API keys, tokens, passwords hardcoded anywhere?)
- Unvalidated user input reaching DB, filesystem, or shell

### SECTION 4: FRONTEND QUALITY
- Does the UI match the spec layout exactly?
- Hardcoded values that should be dynamic (prices, counts, dates)
- Mobile viewport breakage
- JS errors that prevent page functioning
- Loading / error / empty state for every async operation — are all 3 handled?
- Does it look world-class? Or does it look like a rushed prototype?

### SECTION 5: BACKEND QUALITY
- DB operations: try/except with rollback on every write?
- External API calls: timeout + retry + graceful degradation on every call?
- Cron job: does it handle failure without crashing the service?
- Memory leaks: large objects created per-request without cleanup?
- Logging: are errors logged with enough context to debug production issues?

### SECTION 6: WORLD-CLASS GAP ANALYSIS
This is Protocol Pulse — a premium Bitcoin intelligence product.
What would Bloomberg Terminal, Coinbase Advanced, or Blockworks do differently?
What is genuinely missing that would make this impressive to a professional?
DO NOT pad this section. Only include changes with material impact.
If an area is already excellent, explicitly say so — that's equally important.

### SECTION 7: SCORES (0-100 each)
- Backend logic:    X/100
- Frontend/UI:      X/100
- Error handling:   X/100
- Security:         X/100
- Performance:      X/100
- Law compliance:   X/100
- World-class gap:  X/100 (100 = nothing missing, 0 = prototype quality)
- OVERALL:          X/100

### SECTION 8: PRIORITY ACTION PLAN
Every fix and improvement, sorted by impact. Be specific — cite file and line.
Format exactly as:
P0 CRITICAL | [what] | [file:line] | [why it will break production]
P1 HIGH     | [what] | [file:line] | [why it degrades quality]
P2 MEDIUM   | [what] | [file:line] | [enhancement that matters]
P3 LOW      | [what] | [file:line] | [polish]

### SECTION 9: THE ONE THING
If you could only tell the developer one thing to make this dramatically better,
what would it be? One sentence. Make it count.

### SECTION 10: FINAL VERDICT
In 2-3 sentences: is this code ready for production? What must change first?
