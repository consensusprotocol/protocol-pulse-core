        <h1 class="mb-3">Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="text-muted mb-4">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

        <p>
            Protocol Pulse respects your privacy and operates on a minimization principle:
            collect only what is needed to deliver the Signal Terminal, intelligence briefs,
            and account services.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Data We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account data:</strong> email, password hash, and profile preferences when you register.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational logs:</strong> request metadata (IP, user agent, route, timestamp) for security and uptime diagnostics.</li>
            <li><strong>Session data:</strong> cookie/session tokens used to keep authenticated sessions active.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">How We Use Data</h2>
        <p>
            We use data to authenticate users, secure the platform, process premium access,
            improve reliability, and deliver relevant product functionality. We do not sell
            personal data.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Third-Party Processors</h2>
        <p>
            We may rely on payment, infrastructure, and notification providers to run services.
            Those providers process data under their own policies and contractual obligations.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Security</h2>
        <p>
            We apply standard safeguards including hashed credentials, encrypted transport (HTTPS),
            and access controls. No online system is risk-free, but hardening and monitoring are
            continuously maintained.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            You may request access, correction, or deletion of account-related data by contacting
            support. We process requests within a reasonable operational window.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this policy as services evolve. Material changes are reflected by an
            updated effective date on this page.
